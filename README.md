Hello, This is Sreya Sunil, a first year CS-AI student .
I am from Kerala and I enjoy all forms of art, especially painting and music. 
Currently, I have started an additional course on AI/ML and am very interested in the
front end aspect of the day-to-day applications that we use. 
Since the orientation day, AUV club in itself has piqued my interest which led me till here.
I am passionate in learning more of what entails to be a part of this club and I am sure
that I give my 100 percent in anything that I will have to do as a part of AUV
